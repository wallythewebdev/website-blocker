## anti procrasitation device and refocusing tool. 

Lets be hoenst you and I, you're... sorry, we're... fucked... totally fucked. 
Tech companies spend allot of money to buy your time by packaging up your habbits, needs and desires as services that only they can seem to solve. 
Whats worse is the personal cost which comes with this deception. 
Rob me of my money and I can make more (but yes I will be pissed). 
Rob me of my focus, and you steal my potential and future. 

Will power just don't cut the mustard anymore. 

So im making a tool to help with that. 
Maybe I'll even come up with a name for it at some point.
